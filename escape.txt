Nothing in here can give me understanding
What could reconstruct my heart
To show it to the real world
There is no kind of reality
There are no borders, no borders at all
They say nothing to do
Do whatever you want
Next time, next time
You will realize 
That escape is the road unbuild

Take pleasure in trip
